## HOW TO BUILD A SIP B2B USERAGENT?
Well, to this question, I will answer: DONT.
If you need some sip server, you should actually go straight to freeswitch. It is powerfull, and modding it to fullfill your requirement should be easy, and it have media support and almost everything you need so you can setup one very quick.
If you need some really high performance sip server, try opensips.
If you are just interesting in how this sip things work, Well...Lets get started.

## OUR OBJECTIVE
Well...maybe a rfc3621 compatible one? It is big...and since we are build it from the very beginning, we will build a usable one, but not fully implemented everything rfc3621 required. AND, more importantly, this is a **TOY** project, I hope this will let you master SIP, but the project itself is not for product use, just dont use it.

## WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW BEFORE DIVE IN
Well...
We will mainly using c++, and make sure it work well on linux(This mean some feature will only be working on linux, but dont worry, it will be cross platform someday). We will try to make it use as less deps as possible, so we wont be like build the server on top of something like pjsip, but something like asio might be use.
