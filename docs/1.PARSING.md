# PARSING THE SIP

the first thing we will need to work with will be parsing the SIP message.
Since we will build the application from really bottom(namely from the socket), something like the raw data packet is the only thing we are able to get at the very begining.

```bash
$ nc -l -u 5060
```

Suppose we have a server Like above, it listening on port 5060 udp, we should be able to see everything coming though.
If we try to make freeswitch to send inite to there, you will see something like(we might get not only one, since our server wont reply, freeswitch will timed out and resend the invite, if you wait long enough for over 32s there will be 6 invite before freeswitch give up.)

```
